# Submission for Summative Assignment: Linear Regression Optimization and Comparative Modeling

## Introduction
This document accompanies my submission for the Summative Assignment on optimizing a linear regression model using gradient descent and comparing it with Decision Trees and Random Forests models. 

## Work Process
### Notebook Review and Implementation
- **Code Snippets Completion**: I've thoroughly reviewed the provided notebook and completed all the required code snippets. 
- **Passing Unit Tests**: Each section of the notebook was carefully addressed, ensuring that the code passed all the unit tests.

### Exercises
The exercises I completed in the notebook include:
1. **Data Preparation and Analysis**: Preprocessing and understanding the dataset for TV sales prediction.
2. **Implementing Gradient Descent for Linear Regression**: Developing the linear regression model using gradient descent.
3. **Model Optimization and Evaluation**: Fine-tuning the linear regression model for optimal performance.
4. **Decision Trees and Random Forests Models**: Creating and analyzing these models for comparison.
5. **Comparative Analysis**: Evaluating the RMSE of all models and ranking them based on their performance.

## Results and Observations
- **Model Comparisons**: The RMSE of each model was carefully calculated and compared. 
- **Ranking Models**: Based on the RMSE, I ranked the models from best to least performing in terms of accuracy.

## Challenges and Learning
- I faced challenges in optimizing the gradient descent algorithm but managed to overcome them through research and experimentation.
- The comparative analysis of different models provided me with deeper insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each modeling approach.

## Conclusion
This assignment was a comprehensive learning experience in understanding and implementing linear regression optimization and comparative model analysis. It has significantly enhanced my skills in machine learning and data analysis.
